# CS-330-Graphics-Visualization


1. How do I approach designing software?
2. How do I approach developing programs?

The new design skills that I have acquired from this course are numerous. Not having any prior knowledge of graphics design or OpenGL have led me to learn many new skills. The skills include, but not limited to, rendering 2D and 3D objects, applying shaders, utilizing linear algebrain order to create matrices to render objects, apply texture to objects, rendering light objects to a scene in order to provide a sense of realism to it, and implementing camera movement to visualize the scene from
multiple angles throughout. 

The design process that I followed was similar to any other software development project I have been apart of. First, I document user requirements of the scene. This
allows me to understand what is needed to successfully complete the project. After requirments are documented, I then break the project down into iterative sprints to 
complete small portions of the project, in order to not be overwhelemed and ensure portions are being completed to the requirements. After an iteration has been developed intitially, I then test the code in order to identify any bugs or defects present in order to be able to fix them while still managable. These tactics can be implemented to future projects due to their ability to be adapted across many platforms or projects.

Throughout the milestones and the final scene, my process into the design of the assignments evolved immensely. Being completely new to grpahic design and visualization, I was overwhelmed with the breadth of material. This led to a simplistic approach in the first few assignments. As the material became more familiar, I was able to implement my new knowledge and skills into future assignments. This led to a more realistic scene in the final project. By learning basic skills of graphics rendering and visualization, I can now feel comfortable using OpenGL for future projects.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

By having a new comprehension of grpahics and visualization, I can apply them to future courses and the projects that they entail. The ability to add graphics will add
a better user expeirence when interacting with projects or software that I develop. The skills gained through the course also allows me to look further into potential 
career positions in graphics and design. This opens more doors in my career search.
